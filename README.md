I am doing my internship at Elevate Labs. On the first day, I was given tasks about data preprocessing . This involved cleaning data, dealing with missing values, converting categories into numbers, and adjusting the scale of features.

To finish these tasks, I used a step-by-step method that included several important steps like:

- Loads a dataset (CSV file)
- Shows basic info about the data
- Fills missing values (using median or mode)
- Converts categorical (text) data into numbers
- Applies **feature scaling** using `MinMaxScaler` (values between 0 and 1)
- Shows **boxplots** to detect outliers
- Removes outliers using the **IQR method**

required:

-Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
