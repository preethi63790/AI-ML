I am doing my internship at Elevate Labs. On the first day, I was given tasks about data preprocessing . This involved cleaning data, dealing with missing values, converting categories into numbers, and adjusting the scale of features.

To finish these tasks, I used a step-by-step method that included several important steps like:
TASK 1:DATA PREPROCESSING:


- Loads a dataset (CSV file)
- Shows basic info about the data
- Fills missing values (using median or mode)
- Converts categorical (text) data into numbers
- Applies **feature scaling** using `MinMaxScaler` (values between 0 and 1)
- Shows **boxplots** to detect outliers
- Removes outliers using the **IQR method**

required:

 Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

  On my second day of internship ,I was asssigned to a task on (EDA)exploratory data analysis


  The following are the steps i followed to complete the given task,

  TASK 2:EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS:


  - Loads and displays the Iris dataset
- Calculates extended summary statistics:
  - Mean, Median, Standard Deviation, Min, Max, Skewness
- Automatically detects:
  - Outliers (anomalies)
  - Skewed distributions
  - Strong feature correlations (patterns)
- Visualizations:
  - Histograms
  - Boxplots
  - Pairplot by species
  - Correlation heatmap.

    required:

    Python 3.x
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
